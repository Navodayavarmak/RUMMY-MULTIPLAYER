# RUMMY-MULTIPLAYER

This game was created using Python(3.10*) and works fine for below versions too.

In this game users can play multiplayer and can assign the no.of decks, and our intractive voice assistant will help the commands while playing the game 

And the decent requirements are:-

Random - Much used library for our project as it randamize every event which we love on Rummy game.

pyttsx3 - it is used to convert text to speech which is used for voice in our project

datetime - this is an preinstalled lib in python used to work on date and times we used this to greet the users according to time.
